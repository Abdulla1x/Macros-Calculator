"""In-app announcements: committed release notes plus a live status banner.

Two different needs share one endpoint because they share one place in the UI:

* **Release notes** are content, so they live here in code. Adding one needs a
  deploy, which is the right cost for "here's what's new".
* **The status banner** is an incident tool, so it comes from an env var read on
  every request. An outage notice has to be postable from the Render dashboard
  without waiting on a build — the same escape hatch MEAL_AI_MODEL has.

Deliberately no database table: the notes are the same for every user, and
"which ones have I read" is a per-device preference the frontend keeps in
localStorage.

    # 2026-08-05) each promised reset was working or imminent; neither was true,

    # correction gets a NEW id rather than an edit: seen ids accumulate in
    # localStorage, so editing in place reaches nobody who already read the old
    # wording — which is precisely the audience a correction is for.

    # previous two rot. Say what is true and what the user should do about it,
